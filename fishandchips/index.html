    <h2>General information</h2>
    <p>
      If you‚Äôre on this page, it‚Äôs because you contacted me about your driving licence. First of all, THANK YOU! üòä
    </p>
    <h3>‚ö† IMPORTANT ‚ö†</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>I ONLY GIVE LESSONS IN THE CANTON OF FRIBOURG!</strong> And only for the following categories: B, BE, A,
      A35, and A1. It‚Äôs not possible to teach in English because the first aid course, the compulsory ‚Äúsensibilisation‚Äù
      courses, the
      theory test, the practical driving test, and the L2 courses are all given in French or German. I can only help you
      in English during
      the practical lessons, as these are private lessons.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here you‚Äôll find all the important information for your training, so please read it carefully. Don‚Äôt hesitate to
      contact me if you have any questions.
    </p>
