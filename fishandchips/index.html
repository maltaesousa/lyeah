    <h2>General informations</h2>
    <p>
      If you're on this page, it's because you've contacted me for your driving license. First of all, THANK YOU! ðŸ˜Š
    </p>
    <h3>âš  IMPORTANT âš </h3>
    <p>
      <strong>I ONLY PROVIDE LESSONS IN THE CANTON OF FRIBOURG!</strong> And only for categories: B, BE, A, A35, and A1.
      It's not possible to conduct the training in English because first aid, awareness courses, theory, exams,
      practical exams, and L2 courses are all given in French or German. I can assist you in English only during
      practical lessons as they are private lessons.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, you'll find all the important information for your training, so please read it carefully. Don't hesitate to
      contact me if you have any questions.
    </p>
